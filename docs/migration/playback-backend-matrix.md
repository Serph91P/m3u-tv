# Playback Backend Matrix

This matrix defines the Flutter rewrite playback contract before any native plugin work. UI-facing playback code must depend on `PlayerAdapter` only; backend selection, unsupported-media failure, and server-transcode fallback must happen behind that adapter so widgets do not change when the active backend changes.

## Contract invariants

- `PlayerAdapter` exposes imperative controls: `load`, `play`, `pause`, `seek`, `stop`, `dispose`, `setAudioTrack`, `setSubtitleTrack`, and `setPlaybackSpeed`.
- State and errors flow through `onState` and `onError`; widgets observe those streams rather than native implementation events.
- Unsupported direct playback is represented as an unsupported playback exception and may switch to a server-transcode adapter without changing widget code.
- External player launch is not a normal backend in the Flutter contract. The retired Electron external-player path remains reference-only behavior.
- Capability flags describe guaranteed contract support, not every codec a device might decode opportunistically.

## Platform fallback order

| Platform | Direct native/mpv backend | Native fallback backend | Server transcode fallback | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android / Android TV | Android ExoPlayer for common HLS, MPEG-TS, and MP4 streams. | Android MPV fallback for broader containers, advanced codecs, external subtitles, and advanced subtitle formats. | Yes: server-transcoded HLS output when direct/native backends reject unsupported media. | Android TV UI must keep D-pad widgets unchanged while adapter selection changes. |
| tvOS / iOS Apple path | Native mpv via `PlaybackBackend.appleMpvNative` (`edde746/MPVKit`, `vo=avfoundation` + `hwdec=videotoolbox`, modeled on Plezy). Registered as primary on both iOS and tvOS. `AppleAvKitBackend` (`appleAvKit` backend, iOS + tvOS) is the only automatic fallback if the native mpv backend throws a recoverable `PlaybackException`; `MediaKitIosAdapter` has been removed from the adapter registration entirely. | Yes: server-transcoded HLS output when no native/fallback backend can satisfy the source. | Native mpv is the primary path and is confirmed fully working on both iOS and tvOS (video, audio, no crash on back navigation), not "not planned" as an earlier revision of this doc stated; that framing predated the project's GPL-3.0 relicense, which removed the App Store/GPL blocker. The tvOS overlay-scaling cosmetic bug (playback overlay rendering "boxed in" relative to the video) has been fixed. `AppleAvKitBackend`'s native iOS plugin (`ios/Runner/AvKitPlaybackPlugin.swift`) was single-instance only -- a bare `state: _PlayerState?` field, unlike tvOS's `playerId`-keyed `states: [String: _PlayerState]` dictionary -- so opening a second Multiview tile on iOS tore down the first tile's player, and `setVolume` had no native case at all (`MissingPluginException` on every call). Fixed by porting tvOS's `playerId`-keyed multi-instance pattern and `setVolume` case to iOS; also added the Metal-pixel-buffer-compatibility fix tvOS already had. Both platforms now share the same architecture; see `test/playback/avkit_playback_plugin_source_test.dart` for the parity assertions. **Known limitation**: two concurrent UHD/4K Multiview tiles can still hit VideoToolbox concurrent hardware-decode session contention on both iOS and tvOS, same as macOS Multiview (see the Desktop Flutter (macOS) row) -- confirmed on macOS and tvOS, and iOS is expected to share it given the same underlying hardware-decode constraint, though not yet directly isolated from the single-instance bug above during testing. macOS is not part of this path -- see the Desktop Flutter row. HDR is now implemented on both: iOS toggles EDR directly on the display layer (`video-params/sig-peak`-driven), while tvOS requests an actual HDMI display-mode switch via `AVDisplayManager`/`AVDisplayCriteria` (`target-colorspace-hint` is inert on the `avfoundation` VO there) -- both ported from Plezy, both build-verified, neither yet confirmed against real HDR hardware. See `docs/release/platform-release-matrix.md` for full detail. |
| Desktop Flutter (Linux/Windows) | libmpv direct backend via `DesktopLibmpvBackend` (`lib/playback/desktop_libmpv_backend.dart`), one shared Dart class/capability row for both OSes -- the GPU/HDR differences below are native-side only and do not surface as separate Dart capability flags. | No automatic fallback is registered for desktop in `buildPlaybackOrchestrator()`; a native mpv load failure is currently a dead end until the server-transcode adapter below applies, unlike Android/Apple's ExoPlayer/AVKit fallbacks. | Yes: server-transcoded HLS output when libmpv is unavailable or policy rejects the source. | Retired Electron mpv takeover and external launch are behavior references only. **Windows** now renders via a GPU-texture path (`windows/runner/angle_surface_manager.{h,cc}` + `TryLoadGpuTexture` in `desktop_libmpv_backend.cpp`): mpv renders through its OpenGL render API into a D3D11 texture via ANGLE, handed to Flutter as a real `FlutterDesktopGpuSurfaceTexture` (`kFlutterDesktopGpuSurfaceTypeDxgiSharedHandle`), with a runtime fallback to the original SW pixel-buffer path if ANGLE/D3D11 init fails on a given machine. Confirmed working on real Windows hardware (Live TV and VOD, with a dramatic latency improvement over the SW path); HDR toggle behavior specifically has not yet been verified against real HDR10 content. The earlier native-child-window GPU approach (`kGpuWindowPathEnabled`) is a confirmed dead end (DWM does not composite a child window's content under Flutter's flip-model swap chain) and stays disabled, kept only as documented history. **Linux** on Wayland renders via a GPU-rendered `wl_subsurface` video plane (`linux/wayland_video_surface.h/.cc`) driven by mpv's OpenGL render API through its own isolated EGL context, with the same SW pixel-buffer fallback; confirmed working on real Wayland hardware (playback, scrubbing, multiview). It also attempts HDR passthrough via the `wp_color_manager_v1` protocol, implemented following the open-source Plezy player's design but not yet verified against a real HDR-capable display/compositor. X11 sessions have no GPU or HDR path and always use the SW path. A longstanding `loadfile` options-slot bug that broke VOD resume (but not VOD-from-start) on both desktop platforms has been fixed. See `docs/release/platform-release-matrix.md` for full detail and hardware-verification status. |
| Desktop Flutter (macOS) | Native mpv via `PlaybackBackend.macMpvNative` (`edde746/MPVKit`, `vo=gpu-next` + `gpu-context=moltenvk` + `hwdec=videotoolbox`, modeled on Plezy), registered as primary. | None for main playback -- `MediaKitDesktopAdapter` was removed as a fallback in `buildPlaybackOrchestrator()`; there is currently no automatic fallback on macOS if native mpv throws. | Yes: server-transcoded HLS output when native mpv rejects the source (no automatic media_kit fallback in between). | Native mpv is confirmed fully working on macOS (video, audio, subtitles, track switching, seeking, clean back-navigation teardown). macOS Multiview (`buildMultiviewTilePlayer()`) now also uses `MacMpvNativeBackend`, which implements `MultiviewBackend`/`setVolume` and renders each grid tile through its own `AppKitView` keyed by its own `_viewId`/`MpvPlayerCore` (the Swift-side registry already supported N concurrent cores; only the Dart interface conformance and tile-rendering widget were missing). `MediaKitDesktopAdapter`/`media_kit`/`media_kit_video` are no longer used anywhere on macOS. `flutter analyze`/`flutter test`/`flutter build macos` all pass. Click-tested on real hardware: two non-UHD tiles play correctly with independent rendering and per-tile audio-focus muting via `setVolume`. **Known limitation**: two concurrent UHD/4K tiles can render black (video-only reconfig failure) or gray (stalled decode) -- confirmed to be VideoToolbox concurrent hardware-decode session contention, not a Multiview-specific bug (each stream plays fine individually, and non-UHD pairs work fine together in Multiview). The same UHD contention has also been confirmed on tvOS (see the tvOS / iOS Apple path row), so iOS likely shares it too, though that has not been directly tested. No mitigation (e.g. forcing software decode on background tiles, or a UI warning) has been implemented yet. EDR (HDR) is now implemented (`video-params/sig-peak`-driven `CAMetalLayer.wantsExtendedDynamicRangeContent`, gated on the display's real EDR headroom), ported from Plezy, build-verified but not yet confirmed against real HDR content. |
| Server Transcode | N/A. | N/A. | HLS playback URL produced by m3u-editor/server transcode contract. | This backend normalizes playback but does not expose direct stream or embedded-track capabilities. |

## Capability flags by backend

Legend: Yes means guaranteed by the adapter contract for that backend. No means UI must hide/disable or avoid relying on the feature unless a later backend-specific contract expands it.

| Backend | Direct streams | HLS | MPEG-TS | MP4 | Advanced codecs | Audio tracks | Subtitle tracks | External subtitles | Advanced subtitle formats | Speed | Seek | Live seek | Explicit unsupported features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| macOS native mpv (`macMpvNative`, primary on macOS and macOS Multiview) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | live-seek |
| Server transcode fallback | No | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | No | direct-streams, mpeg-ts, mp4, advanced-codecs, audio-track-selection, subtitle-track-selection, embedded-subtitles, external-subtitles, advanced-subtitle-formats, playback-speed, live-seek |

## UI transparency requirement

The adapter chosen by playback orchestration may start as a direct native backend and end as server transcode for the same `PlaybackSource`. UI code must not branch on ExoPlayer, MPVKit, libmpv, or server-transcode implementation classes. It may read `PlaybackState.backend` and `PlaybackCapabilities` to label/debug behavior or hide unsupported controls, but control dispatch remains the same `PlayerAdapter` method calls.
